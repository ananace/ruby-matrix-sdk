## 2.0.0 - 2020-02-14

**NB**, this release includes backwards-incompatible changes;  
- Changes room state lookup to separate specific state lookups from full state retrieval.
  This will require changes in client code where `#get_room_state` is called to retrieve
  all state, as it now requires a state key. For retrieving full room state,
  `#get_room_state_all` is now the method to use.
- Changes some advanced parameters to named parameters, ensure your code is updated if it makes use of them
- Fixes SSL verification to actually verify certs (#9)

- Adds multiple CS API endpoints
- Adds `:room_id` key to all room events
- Adds `:self` as a valid option to the client abstraction's `#get_user` method
- Separates homeserver part stringification for MXIDs
- Exposes some previously private client abstraction methods (`#ensure_room`, `#next_batch`) for easier bot usage
- Changes room abstraction member lookups to use `#get_room_joined_members`, reducing transferred data amounts
- Fixes debug print of methods that return arrays (e.g. CS `/room/{id}/state`)

## 1.5.0 - 2019-10-25

- Adds error event to the client abstraction, for handling errors in the background listener
- Adds an `open_timeout` setter to the API

- Adds the option to change the logger globally or per-object.

## 1.3.0 - 2019-07-16

- Improves response handling to add accessors recursively
- Removes MatrixSdk extensions from the global scope,
  if you've been using these in your own code you must now remember to
  `extend MatrixSdk::Extensions` in order for them to be available.

## 1.2.0 - 2019-06-28
